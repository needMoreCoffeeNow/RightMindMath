<p>When you install RMM on another device you need access to the information now stored in your RightMindMath Google sheet.</p>
<p>Be sure you have installed RMM as a PWA on the new device before working thru this Topic.</p>
<p>If you can open your Google Sheet on the device, then open it now. You can skip the email suggestion below.</p>
<p>If you cannot open your Google Sheet on the device, then you need to get the information from the sheet to the device.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this will likely be by copying/pasting the information you need into an email, and send it to an account used on the device</p>
<p>Copy the following fields into the email from your RightMindMath sheet:
<ol>
<li>The 60 character Sync Key (Control sheet cell <b>A4</b>)</li>
<li>The URL String (Control sheet cell <b>A8</b>)</li>
<li>The 9-digit <b>Iduser</b> from the table with user data)</li>
<li>The <b>Pass Code</b> from cell <b>A1</b> in the Iduser sheet</li>
