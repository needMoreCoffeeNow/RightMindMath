<p>For the next step you must both RMM &amp; your RightMindMath sheet open at the same time.</p>

<div class="step">Step 1</div>
<p>If RMM Settings are not shown, click the <u>Gear Icon</u> at the top-right of the screen to open Settings.</p>
<p>Click on the <u>User Setup</u> button.</p>

<div class="step">Step 4</div>
<p>After you click <u>Continue</u> in the previous step you will see this dialog.</p>
<p>Before you click <u>OK</u> select all the text inside the text box.</p>
<p>Note: this text string is setup to paste as three separate cell values in the next step. Be sure copy the entire string.</p>

<hr><hr>
<div class="step">Step 5</div>
<p>Navigate to the browser window with your RightMindMath Sheet.</p>
<p>Click the first empty cell in <b>column A</b> in the table with the light-blue background. Note: be sure you are in <b>column A</b>.</p>
<p>Paste the string you just copied into this cell.</p>
<p>The result of the past should be columns A, B, &amp; C having the information from RMM.</p>

<hr><hr>
<div class="step">Step 6</div>
<p>First: Click colum B to select the cell with the 9-digit <b>Iduser</b> value.</p>
<p>Copy the 9-digit <b>Iduser</b> value.</p>
<p>Second: Click the "+" (plus) button at the bottom-left of your sheet.</p>
<p>When you click this Add Sheet button a new "sheet" (or "ply") will be added to RightMindMath.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/img_en_us/05_06_click_add_sheet.jpg"  class="img_responsive"></p></p>

<hr><hr>
<div class="step">Step 7</div>
<p>Immediately after you click <u>Add Sheet</u> in the previous step, you will be viewing a new, blank sheet.</p>
<p>At this point, the title of the sheet will be something like "Sheet1".</p>
<p>First: Double click the "Sheet1" title, and past the 9-digit <b>Iduser</b> as the sheet title.</p>
<p>Note: in the image below, we are showing the sheet AFTER the <b>Iduser</b> value has been pasted into the title.</p>
<p>Second: Click cell <b>A1</b>. It is <b>very, very important</b> that you are in cell <b>A1</b>.</p>
<p>Type an easy to remember <b>passcode</b> into this cell. You do not need to make it super-long, and super difficult. There are many layers of security prior to this <b>passcode</b>.</p>
<p>An easy way to create a good <b>passcode</b> is to combine two common four or five letter words with a number between them. This has been done for Maria&#039;s sheet</p>
<p>You may want to change the color of the background of cell <b>A1</b> &amp; increase the font size. Use the buttons highlighted by the orange boxes to do this.</p>
<p>Please note: Cell <b>A1</b> is the ONLY CELL you should ever change in this sheet. As you start syncing, RMM will fill up other cells & rows with texts. Never alter these values</p>
