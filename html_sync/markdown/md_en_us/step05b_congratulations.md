<p>You are done setting up your RightMindMath sheet (unless you are adding more children).</p>
<p>If you do add more children simply follow the steps above for each child. There really is no practical limit. A mentor/teacher may have a sheet with 20+ Iduser tabs. This will be no problem given the massive power Google gives you as a sheet owner.</p>
<p>From this point, you will only use the RightMindMath sheet as a means to copy/paste all the values needed when you setup additional devices such as your child&#039;s pad or phone.</p>
<p>All the values you will need for additional device setups are contained in your <u>Control</u> sheet.</p>
