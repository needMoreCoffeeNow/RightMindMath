<p><span style="background:#fff;color:#cc0052;">Step 6</span><br>Close the browser window used to install RMM (Step 2 above). Then locate the RightMindMath app installed on your phone. Open then app, and follow the instruction to name your local database.<br><br>Note: The reason you need to do this is that when you choose to install RMM Safari will not download all the necessary files until you open the app for the first time. So if you are offline when you first open RMM, you will be informed you are not online. After the initial time you open RMM online, all the needed files will have been downloaded, and you will be able to use RMM when offline.</p>
