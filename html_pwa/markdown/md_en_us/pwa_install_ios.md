<p><span style="background:#fff;color:#cc0052;">Step 1</span><br>Follow the instructions at the link below to create a browser profile specific for installing RightMindMath:<br>
 <a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/create-multiple-safari-profiles-iphd27a9ff22/ios">Safari iOS Browser Profiles</a> <span style="font-size:75%;">(opens a new window)</span>
<p>Note: You should use a distinctive color for the new profile to ensure you know it is in use for the following steps.
</p>
<p>Remember: The reason for using a separate profile is to guard against manually deleting your local browser data. There is no real resource cost for having a separate browser profile. So setup this profile, use it to install RMM, and then leave it unused (or at least never manually delete browser data if you do use it.)</p>

<hr><hr>

<p><span style="background:#fff;color:#cc0052;">Step 7</span><br>Close the browser window used to install RMM (Step 2 above). Then locate the RightMindMath app installed on your phone. Open then app, and follow the instruction to name your local database.<br><br>Note: The reason you need to do this is that when you choose to install RMM Safari will not download all the necessary files until you open the app for the first time. So if you are offline when you first open RMM, you will be informed you are not online. After the initial time you open RMM online, all the needed files will have been downloaded, and you will be able to use RMM when offline.</p>
