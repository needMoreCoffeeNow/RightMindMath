<p>Use either Edge or Chrome on Mac or Windows to install RightMindMath as a PWA. Safari on MacOS is also a good option as of their Sonoma OS. Other browsers have not been tested, and may not work</p>

<p>Chrome, Edge, and Safari are all very peformant on both Mac and Windows. Each runs the same RMM code, and each adheres well to web standards. Unlike some other web apps which install a separate, memory-hungry browser runtime, when you run RMM in either, both use a very small amount of system resources because they utilize the native browser.</p>

<p>Note: Your version of Chrome or Edge may be different than those used below. This may result in slight differences from the instructions. However these should be minor, and easily worked around.</p>

<p><span style="background:#fff;color:#cc0052;">Step 1</span><br>Use a separate browser profile to avoid the potential issue of losing your RMM local storage should you chose to manually delete your browser data. It is very easy to setup a separate browser profile. Simply do this, ensure you are using that profile when you install RMM, and then leave the profile unused after installation. (At least never manually delete browser data if you do use it). The links below explain how to setup a separate profile:

<li><a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105100">Safari</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Note: You should use a distinctive color for the new profile to ensure you know it is in use for the following steps.
</p>
<p>Remember: The reason for using a separate profile is to guard against manually deleting your local browser data. There is no real resource cost for having a separate browser profile. So setup this profile, use it to install RMM, and then leave it unused (or at least never manually delete browser data if you do use it.)</p>

<li>Make sure you are in the newly created profile</li>
<li>Type in the url: <span style="background:#ffffcc;color:darkblue;font-weight:bold;padding-left:5px;padding-right:5px;">rightmindmath.com</span></li>
<li>Scroll down and reopen the PWA installation instructions.</li>
<li>Open the <b><u>Install on a computer</u></b> topic</li>
<li>Continue with <u>Step 3</u> below.</li>

<p><span style="background:#fff;color:#cc0052;">Step 4</span><br>Click the icon on the right side of the address bar that look like a download/share icon with an arrow. On Edge you can also click the three small vertical dots in the top right corner. To add the PWA using Safari use the <u>File Menu -> Add to Doc</u> option.</p>

<p><span style="background:#fff;color:#cc0052;">Step 5</span><br>Follow the various prompts to install RightMindMath.</p>
<hr><hr>

<p><span style="background:#fff;color:#cc0052;">Step 6</span><br>Close the browser window used to install RMM (Step 2 above). Then locate the RightMindMath app installed on your computer. Open then app, and follow the instruction to name your local database.<br><br>Note: The reason you need to do this is that when you choose to install RMM some browsers will not download all the necessary files until you open the app for the first time. If this is true, then if you are offline when you first open RMM, you will be informed you are not online. After the initial time you open RMM online, all the needed files will have been downloaded, and you will be able to use RMM when offline.</p>

<hr><hr>

<p><span style="background:#fff;color:#cc0052;">Windows Details</span><br>On Windows computers both Chrome &amp; Edge do a good job of providing access to RMM. Both will put a shortcut on your Desktop. Edge also gives the option of adding RMM to your Task Bar.</p>

<p><span style="background:#fff;color:#cc0052;">Apple Details</span><br>The instructions for Windows above will apply (possibly with slight variances) for Chrome and Edge running on a Mac. When installed, The RightMindMath.app will be located in either the following folders in <b>the Applications folder shown for your User Name</b> (this is different from the system Application folder located under the main drive): <u>Applications>Chrome Apps</u> or <u>Applications>Edge Apps.</u> Access the app from these folders, or drag the app to your Dock to launch it from there.</p>
