Here is how to make this so:</p><p><b>Have your child use RMM regularly (hopefully daily):</b> As explained in a previous Topic right-mind learning requires doing a lot of single-digit arithmetic. As also noted, this is not so burdensome for your child because RMM is relaxing &amp; fun. So please try to set up a time for 10 to 20 minutes of RMM each day. Yep, that&#039;s all it takes.</p><p><b>Regularly review the performance charts:</b> (Once every few days or weekly.) RMM&#039;s easy-to-use charts are important because they show your child&#039;s progress. Your review of the charts also tells your child you care &#151; that is very important also.</p><p><b>Manage pop-ups:</b> RMM uses popups to pause the process to give a moment for you child to consider what has happened (the problem just solved), or what is about to happen (e.g. borrowing). At some point, though, it will be more important for your child to <i>get into the flow</i>. Ask your child every once in a while if they want the popups off.<p><p><b>Help with &amp; manage notes:</b> RMM presents text notes to explain things like carries &amp; borrows. For example when doing single-digit addition you will very quickly get a note explaining the carry for an equation like 8+3=11. You should be sure your child understands these notes. As with popups, the notes are less necessary as your child advances &amp; they may start to interrupt the flow. Ask your child every once in a while if they want the notes for the equation they are using to be shut off.<p><p><b>Watch the recommended videos with your child:</b> In both the Topics, and in some RMM dialogs there are links to great &amp; important math concept videos. Be sure to watch these with your child &amp; talk about them enough for you to be confident your child understands them.<p><p><b>Walk thru Multi-Step Problems:</b> When your child is doing a multi-digit or division problem RMM walks them thru the solution process step-by-step. When first starting out on these problems read the step text out loud, and talk about it briefly with your child. The steps for each problem type are the same, so you only need to do this once. Note: for narrow devices like phones, these multi-step problems are presented better when the device is held horizontally in "landscape mode".</p>'

Consider turning this popup off to really maximize the flow.</li><li><b>Borrowing Needed:</b> For multi-step subtraction problems, this popup alerts your child that the borrowing transformation &amp; explanation (if it is on) will show in the upcoming step.

The repeating pattern when doing Ordered is pretty strong, so it can lead to false measures of instant recall in the charts. Working thru Random after Ordered, though, will ensure you child&#039;s true instant recall.</p><p>A harder decision is wheter to start with 0-10 then 11-20, or start off with 0-20.

                    <p>Here are some of the main reasons to use RMM:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Helps your engagement &amp; interest</li>

                    <p>Item one (<i><b>engagement &amp; interest</b></i>) is the most important factor at work here. <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Engaging with, and being interested in your child&#039;s learning process is much, much more important than the app you use.</span> Fortunately RMM makes this easy &amp; natural for you.</p>
                    <p>A series of Topics is below. Yes there are a lot of them. They hopefully both explain RMM completely, and help you best assist your child. <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Please take the time to read them.</span></p>
                    <p>To really understand the Topics, use the link below to open &amp; run RMM in a separate window. Use the browser-run version of the app to use RMM as your child would when it is a PWA.</p>
