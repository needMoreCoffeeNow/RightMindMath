Now anytime you meet them again, even years later, you instantly know their name. It just "happens".</p><p>RMM&#039;s design enables a child to learn the patterns of simple arithmetic.

                    <p>Right Mind Math <strong>(RMM)</strong> is a free, open-source math app. It develops instant recall for simple arithmetic, and shows  how easy math can be once simple arithmetic is mastered.</p>
                    <hr style="border: 1px solid #000;">
                    <p>Here are some of the main reasons to use RMM:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Helps your engagement &amp; interest</li>
                        <li>Free &amp; Open Source &#151; forever</li>
                        <li>Pretty darn well-designed app</li>
                        <li>100% private</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Item one (<i><b>engagement &amp; interest</b></i>) is the most important factor at work here. <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Engaging with, and being interested in your child&#039;s learning process is much, much more important than the app you use.</span> Fortunately RMM makes this easy &amp; natural for you.</p>
                    <p>A series of Topics is below. Please take the time to read them to understand why RMM is such a great app for learning arithmetic.</p>
