Your review of the charts also tells your child you care &#151; that is very important also.</p><p><b>Manage pop-ups:</b> RMM uses popups to pause the process to give a moment for you child to consider what has happened (the problem just solved), or what is about to happen (e.g. borrowing). At some point, though, it will be more important for your child to <i>get into the flow</i>. Ask your child every once in a while if they want the popups off.<p><p><b>Help with &amp; manage notes:</b> RMM presents text notes to explain things like carries &amp; borrows. For example when doing single-digit addition you will very quickly get a note explaining the carry for an equation like 8+3=11. You should be sure your child understands these notes. As with popups, the notes are less necessary as your child advances &amp; they may start to interrupt the flow. Ask your child every once in a while if they want the notes for the equation they are using to be shut off.<p><p><b>Watch the recommended videos with your child:</b> In both the Topics, and in some RMM dialogs there are links to great &amp; important math concept videos.

                    <p>Right Mind Math <strong>(RMM)</strong> is a <u>Free &amp; Open Source Software</u> math app. It develops instant recall for simple arithmetic, and shows  how easy math can be once simple arithmetic is mastered.</p>
                    <hr style="border: 1px solid #000;">
                    <p>Here are some of the main reasons to use RMM:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Helps your engagement &amp; interest</li>
                        <li>Free &amp; Open Source &#151; forever</li>
                        <li>Pretty darn well-designed app</li>
                        <li>100% private</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Item one (<i><b>engagement &amp; interest</b></i>) is the most important factor at work here. <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Engaging with, and being interested in your child&#039;s learning process is much, much more important than the app you use.</span> Fortunately RMM makes this easy &amp; natural for you.</p>
                    <p>A series of Topics is below. <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Please take the time to read them</span> to understand why RMM is such a great app for learning arithmetic.</p>
                    <p>To give RMM a try <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rightmindmath.com/app/rightmindmath_en_us.html">Click&nbsp;Here</a> <span style="font-size:85%;">(opens a new window).</span></p>
                    <hr style="border: 1px solid #000;">
                    <p>RMM is a Progressive Web App (PWA) like <span style="color:#C70039;font-size:90%;"><i><strong>Wordle. </strong></i> </span></span> <span style="font-size:85%;">(Unlike Wordle, RMM is both Free &amp; Open Source.)</span> Even though RMM runs great in a web browser window, <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">it is important to install it as a PWA.</p>
