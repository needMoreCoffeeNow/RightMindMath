<p>It is conceivable that RMM might be used by a mentor or teacher to aide a group of children.</p>

<p>In this scenario the process of syncing &amp; analyzing each child&#039;s performance using RMM&#039;s <u>Sync & Stats Menus</u> would not be practical.</p>

<p>To better handle a group of children, RMM provides a second Python script to automate downloading &amp; analyzing usage data.</p>

<p>Each child works individually on their Chromebook, computer, phone, or pad. Each device uses the RMM <u>Sync Menu</u> to upload its usage data.</p>

<p>A second RMM Python script is then used by the mentor to automate the process of downloading &amp; analyzing the CSV files for the group.</p>
