<p>It is conceivable that RMM might be used by a mentor or teacher to aide a group of children.</p>

<p>In this scenario the process of syncing &amp; analyzing each child&#039;s performance using RMM&#039;s <u>Sync & Stats Menus</u> would not be practical. More practical would be a Python script that fully automates everything.</p>

<p>Rather than develop this teacher/mentor process alone, RMM&#039;s Software Author will seek out a teacher/mentor group to help provide input regarding how to optimally setup this process.</p>

<p>Please check this Topic periodically for updates about progress.</p>
