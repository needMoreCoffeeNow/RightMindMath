<p>There are three reasons to install RMM as a PWA:</p>

<ol>
<li>Works when you are off-line</li>
<li>More performant</li>
<li><b><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">No automatic database deletion</b></span></li>
</ol>

<p>The last reason is the most important. The data RMM uses is stored by the browser in a database located in what is called <u>local storage</u>.</p>

<p>Browsers are very aggressive about clearing out web site local storage. If you do not visit an app website for just a few days, it is very likely the next time visit the site your local storage may be gone. Finally, please note that if you occasionally chose to manuallay delete your browser history (often a good idea), you will want to pay attention to <u>Step 1</u> in the PWA Installation guide which outlines easy work-arounds to this potential problem.</p>

<p>Three things happen when you tell your web browser to install RMM as a PWA:</p>

<ol>
<li>The html, script & styling files are downloaded</li>
<li>App storage is separated from broswer storage</li>
<li><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">No automatic app storage deletion</span></li>
</ol>

<p>When installed as a PWA the browser that opens &amp; runs RMM will start up up faster using the downloaded files.  It also will work when you are off-line again because of the downloads. And, most importantly, your data will not be deleted.</p>

<p>Finally it is important to mention that RMM is a relatively tiny app with respect to local storage used. It takes only a few megabytes of device resources.</p>

<p>Most apps from the various <i>App Stores</i> use compiled tech that generates giant app files: tens or hundreds of megabytes in size.</p>

<p>RMM is super efficient because it uses very basic &#151; yet still very powerful &#151; web browser technologies which were designed to be hyper-efficient and very small.</p>
