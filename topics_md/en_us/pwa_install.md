<p>There are three reasons to install RMM as a PWA:</p>

<ol>
<li>Works when you are off-line</li>
<li>More performant</li>
<li><b><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">No automatic database deletion</b></span></li>
</ol>

<p>The last reason is the most important. The data RMM uses is stored by the browser in a database located in what is called <u>local storage</u>.</p>

<p>Browsers are very aggressive about clearing out web site local storage. If you do not visit an app website for just a few days, it is very likely the next time visit the site your local storage will be gone &#151; disappeared forever. YIKES.</p>

<p>Two things happen when you tell your web browser to install RMM as a PWA:</p>

<ol>
<li>The app data &amp; files are stored in a different location</li>
<li><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">No automatic local storage deletion</span></li>
</ol>

<p>When installed as a PWA the browser that opens &amp; runs RMM <span style="font-size:85%">(just like accessing the web site)</span> starts up faster.  It also will work when you are off-line. And, most importantly, your data will not be deleted.</p>

<p>Finally it is important to mention that RMM is a relatively tiny app with respect to local storage used. It takes only a few megabytes of device resources.</p>

<p>Most apps from the various <i>App Stores</i> use compiled tech that generates giant app files: tens or hundreds of megabytes in size.</p>

<p>RMM is super efficient because it uses very basic &#151; yet still very powerful &#151; web browser technologies which were designed to be hyper-efficient and very small.</p>
