<p>It is very important that your child <b>"imagines the right answer".</b> It is also very important to explain to your child that being wrong a lot when starting out is OK... in fact it is a good thing.</b></p>

<p>What does <b>imagine the right answer</b> mean, and why is it important?</p>

<p>Most children think they need to be right the first time. So they calculate the right answer. This is often expressed by finger counting, or mouthing the counts. <b>This is BAD.</b></p>

<p>Calculation is a completely left-mind activity. It causes the right-mind to "go quiet". So no right-mind learning.</b> Calculating is also tiring, and your child likely will feel pressure "to be right".</p>

<p>Imagining the right answer is simple. Tell you child to look at the equation, and look at the four answers. <b>Which one feels/looks right?</b> Click on it. If it is not right, repeat with the remaining answers. The right one will be found. <span style="font-size:90%>Note: imagining the right answer is not guessing. Guessing is just clicking with any prior thought.</span></p>

<p>Initially imagining the right answer leads to frequent wrong answers. However, after doing hundreds &amp; hundreds of problems the right answer will be found almost every first click. This is because the right-mind has learned the answer. Imagining is replaced by instant recall. No calculations needed. It just "happens".</p>

<p>You may think hundreds &amp; hundreds of problems is a reach. If your child was calcing every one this would be true. Calcing is tiring and can be stressful. Right-mind engagement, though, is more of a flow. You will likely be surprised how easy &amp; relaxing it can be.</p>
