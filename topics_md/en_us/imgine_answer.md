<p><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">When doing RMM single-digit problems it is important that your child <b>"imagines the right answer".</b></span>

<p>It is also very important to explain to your child that <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">being wrong a lot when starting out is OK &#151; in fact it is a good thing.</span></b></p>

<p>What does <b>imagine the right answer</b> mean, and why is it important?</p>

<p>Most children think they need to be right the first time. So they calculate the right answer. <span style="font-size:90%">(Virtually all math apps require this.)</span> This is often expressed by finger counting, or silently speaking the counts as the left-mind works thru them.</p>

<p><b>This is BAD.</b> <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Calculation is a 100% left-mind activity. It causes the right-mind to "go quiet". So no right-mind learning.</span> Calculating is also tiring, and your child likely will feel pressure "to be right" (not fun).</p>

<p>Imagining the right answer is simple. Tell your child to look at the equation, and look at the four answers. <ul><li><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Which one do they imagine is right?</span> or</li><li><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Which one feels/looks right?</span></li></ul> Click on it. If it is not right, repeat with the remaining answers. The right one will be found. <span style="font-size:90%">Note: imagining the right answer is not guessing. Guessing is just clicking without prior thought.</span></p>

<p>Initially imagining the right answer leads to frequent wrong answers. However, after doing hundreds &amp; hundreds of problems the right answer will be found every first click. <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">This is because the right-mind has learned the answer.</span> Imagining is replaced by instant recall. No calculations needed. It just "happens".</p>

<p>You may think hundreds &amp; hundreds of problems is a reach. If your child was "calcing" every one this would be true. Calcing is tiring and can be stressful. <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Right-mind engagement, though, is more of a flow. You will likely be surprised how easy &amp; relaxing it can be (fun).</span></p>
