<p>OK. Addition & Subtraction = <b><u>DONE.</u></b></p>

<p>On to Multiplication.</p>

<p>Multiplication will likely be a BIG CONFIDENCE booster. RMM is really great the way it presents multiplication. Also the two videos below are both truly excellent explaining multiplication. So expect quick advancement.</p>

<p>There is a lot of single-digit patterns to learn. The equations span 1-9 as the primary digit, and 0-20 as the second digit. Remember from the arithmetic overview video, though, that 3x9=9x3, so half the problems will be repeats. Your child should progress quickly.</p>

<p>Also if you child has a good grasp of <u>"...any number x 1 = that number"</u> you likely can skip the ones.</p>

<hr>

<p>You should progress thru multiplication by working up from 1 to 9. You have three options for each number:
<ol>
<li>Ordered vs. Random presentation</li>
<li>Starting at 0 or 11, and</li>
<li>Ending at 10 or 20</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Always start you child with <u>Ordered</u>. This will really get them into the flow because there is a repeating pattern for each "times table". You should also be aggresive about shuting of the "Next Problem" popup doing ordered so <u>the flow is strong</u>.</p>

<p>Be sure to switch to Random after Odered. The repeating pattern when doing Ordered is pretty strong, so it can lead to false measures of instant recall in the charts. Working thru Random after Ordered, though, will ensure you child&#039;s true instant recall.</p>

<p>A harder decision is wheter to start with 0-10 then 11-20, or start off with 0-20. You should let your child do both, talk with them, and then make your decision.</p>

Once your child is has instant recall with all the one digit multiplication tables, move on to two-digit multiplication. <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Get Ready for the Second AHA!! Moment.</span></p>

<p>Solving 2-digit multiplication is a series of one-digit multiplications, then one-digit addtions. Lots of <b>super-easy steps</b> since your child has instant recall for each one. The video below does is fantastic explaining all this. <p><span style="font-size:90%;">(Note: RMM&#039;s process for showing the m2 process is nearly identical to the video.)</span></p>
