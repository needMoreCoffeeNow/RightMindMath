<p>RMM strives to provide you 100% privacy. Some compromises are made to do this, but they are justified because <span style="background-color:#ffffcc"><b><u>You Deserve 100% Privacy.</u></b></span>

<p>To ensure privacy you need to own the server RMM talks to when syncing across devices. Your server must be 100% reliable, performant, and availabe 24x7. <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">If RMM (or any app) talks to a server not under your control it is practically guaranteed your privacy will not be respected.</span> Sad but true.</p>

<p>Of course no one expects you to buy &amp; host your own server particularly with the specs above. You can achieve pretty much the same thing, though, by using your own, private Google Sheet. Your private sheet will provide a secure interface which will allow you to sync across devices with 100% privacy &#151; <b>guaranteed.</b></p>

<p>The one compromise with this approach is that you need to be precise &amp; careful setting up your sync sheet. The process is not hard. Following some instructions is all that is needed. This is all covered in the next Topic.</p>

<p>Finally it is important to note that <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">apart from syncing, RMM never, NEVER talks to anyone or anything over the internet.</span> <b>100% Privacy Guaranteed.</b></p>
