<p>Start subtraction after you child has mastered addition levels a1, a2, &amp; a3 <span style="font-size:90%;">(1 thru 3 digit additions)</span>. Subtraction introduces both the concept of negative numbers &amp; the relatively complex process of borrowing <span style="font-size:90%;">(compared to addition&#039;s carries).</span></p>

<hr>

<p>The starting place for subtraction is 1-digit problems which have answers that are not negative (e.g. 8-7=1). There will also be problems with zero as the answer (8-8=0).</p>

<hr>

<p>The next step is to set the top subtraction option to value from 1-5. This results in 10-50% of the problems having negative answers (7-8=-1).</p>

<p>Finally, when you child is comfortable with negative answers with the settings above, change the second subtraction option to 1-3.</p>

<p>This will result in negative answer problems where BOTH upper &amp; lower numbers are negatives (-8-7=-15) 10-30% of the time negative problems are shown.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:90%;">Note: RMM does not show problems like -2+3=1 or 2-(-3)=5 or -2-(-3)=1. These are equivalent to 3-2=1, 2+3=5, and 3-2=1. The video above does a pretty good job explaining these equation refactors.</span></p>

<hr>

<p>Once your child has instant recall for one-digit subtraction it is time to move to 2-digit then 3-digit subtraction.</p>

<p>As with multi-digit addition RMM carefully walks your child thru the borrowing process. The process is not hard, but the concept of borrowing can be harder than carries for additions.</p>

<p>You have the option of setting up multi-digit subtractions to have borrows on/off. You may choose to start with "off" to let your child gain confidence. Watch the excellent video below. The video is sooo excellent you may start with borrowing "on".</p>

<p>The process RMM uses for highlighting borrows includes a popup that pauses the equation with an alert that <u>Borrowing is Needed</u>. This is followed by the borrowing being shown &amp; text explaining the borrow.</p>

<p>Because <u>flow</u> is a valuable learning mode with RMM, you will likely want to shut the popup off relatively soon. The text is less intrusive so an early shut off is less important versus the popup.</p>
