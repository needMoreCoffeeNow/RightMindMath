<p>Popups are little text notes designed to pause the flow. They can and at some point should all be shut off because <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">once you child understands the point, or has begun to really master the problem set, an uninterrupted flow is a very good thing.</span> The flow is both relaxing, and important for right-mind learning</p>

<p>The three types of popups are:
<ul>
<li><b>Number Position:</b> This alerts before the next step in a multi-step process. It simply identifies that the "tens" or "hundreds" number place is going to be used next. You can shut this off quite early, and may choose to never turn it on if your child has a solid grasp of number positions. <span style="font-size:90%;">(Note: The video linked to in other Topics covering number position is really excellent.)</span></li>
<li><b>Next Problem:</b> The popup is used to pause the flow for a moment after completing a single-digit problem. It gives your child a chance to contemplate what they just solved. As you child begins to master the problem level this is less important. Consider turning this popup off to really maximize the flow.</li>
<li><b>Borrowing Needed:</b> For multi-step subtraction problems, this popup alerts your child that the borrowing transformation &amp; explanation (if it is on) will show in the upcoming step. It is really only needed when first getting used to how RMM shows borrowing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, note that <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">when a popup is shown, the entire screen is "the button".</span> There is a natural inclination to move the mouse/finger over the text to click "the button". Not needed &#151; and can be a bit annoying. Just click anywhere. No need to move the mouse or your finger.
