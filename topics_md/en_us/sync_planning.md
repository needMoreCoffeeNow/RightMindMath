<p>Please read this topic before starting to use RMM. The reason for this is that <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">good <u>Sync Planning</u> may affect how you do things.</span></p>

<p>RMM&#039;s Sync process is valuable whether your child is using just one or multiple devices. When using one device syncing provides data backup. For multiple devices you get both backup &amp; shared data across all devices.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">You will want to setup your Google Sheet sync process immediately after your first installation of RMM as a PWA.</span> Setting up the Google Sheet may be easier using a computer rather than a phone.</p>

<p>Even if your child will be using RMM solely on their phone, it may make sense to:<ol><li>Install RMM on your computer,<li>Setup the Google Sheet sync, and then<li>Install RMM on the phone.</ol></p>

<p>The reason for this is that a trackpad/mouse and a larger screen are likely to be easier to use for the Sync setup. A phone can work, but it may be harder.</p>

<p>Since RMM is such a small and effective app, there are no real issues installing it first on your computer. You may also find charting your child&#039;s progress easier on a computer.</p>

<p>Once the Google Sync Sheet has been setup, it is easy to install RMM on devices &amp; use the Sheet for setting up Syncing on each device.</p>

<p>The complete instructions for setting up your 100% private Google Sheet are here: <a target="_blank" href="./app/sync/sync_instructions_en_us.html">Sync Setup Instructions</a> <span style="font-size:75%;">(opens a new window)</span>.</p>
