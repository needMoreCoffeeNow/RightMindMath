<p><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">The browser you use to install RMM as a PWA will be the browser that always runs the app.</span></p>

<p>For computers running Windows or the MacOS you should use either Microsft Edge or Google Chrome browsers. Apple, for unknown reasons, does not support the <u>long-ago accepted PWA standard</u> with MacOS Safari. (This will change with the upcoming Sonoma release expected Fall 2023.)<p>

<p>If you have a choice, you may prefer Chrome when using it on a Mac. Edge when running the app on the Mac opens the Edge browser each time you open the app. Chrome does not do this. On Windows Edge and Chrome run the app similarly, so either is a good choice.</p>

<p>On Apple iOS devices use Apple&#039;s Safari browser. iOS Safari <span style="font-size:85%;">(unlike MacOS)</span> is an outstanding browser for running RMM as a PWA.</p>

<p>On Android devices use the native Chrome browser which should be the default app for most popular phones. If not you should be able to install it.</p>

<p>There are many other desktop browsers, and some variations in iOS &amp; Android device browsers. These may work, but have not been tested. Your best bet is to use the recommended browsers.</p>
