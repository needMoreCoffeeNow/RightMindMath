<p><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">The browser you use to install RMM as a PWA will be the browser that always runs the app.</span></p>

<p>For computers running Windows or the MacOS you should use either Microsft Edge or Google Chrome browsers. Apple, for unknown reasons, does not support the <u>long-ago accepted PWA standard</u> with MacOS Safari.<p>

<p>Between Edge &amp; Chrome on a computer, you may prefer Edge. Both browsers run the app equally well. When presenting the scalable vector graphics RMM uses extensively Edge renders them a bit more crisply than Chrome.</p>

<p>On Apple iOS devices use Apple&#039;s Safari browser. iOS Safari <span style="font-size:85%;">(unlike MacOS)</span> is an outstanding browser for running RMM as a PWA.</p>

<p>On Android devices use the native Chrome browser which should be the default app for most popular phones. If not you should be able to install it.</p>

<p>There are many other desktop browsers, and some variations in iOS &amp; Android device browsers. These may work, but have not been tested. Your best bet is to use the recommended browsers.</p>
