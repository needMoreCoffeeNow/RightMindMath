<p>OK. Addition & Subtraction & Multiplication = <b><u>DONE.</u></b></p>

<p>On to Long Division.</p>

<p>Long Division is the final BIG CONFIDENCE booster. It is a pretty complex process made easy by instant recall.</p>

<p>The videos below are both excellent. They also present the solution in a format nearly identical to how RMM presents the long division process</p>

<p>The first video shows problems without decimal place answers. Which is an option for RMM. The second provides a really good explanation of decimal places &amp; long division. It goes a bit beyond RMM, but its process is also nearly identical to RMM.</p>

<hr>

<p>You should progress thru long-division by steadily increasing the complexity of the problem. The options are:
<ol>
<li>1 or 2 digit dividend (372/3=93 vs. 372/93=4)</li>
<li>Whole answers vs. answers with a decimal</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Start with 1-digit dividends. Likely next move to 1-digit dividends with decimals. Then 2-digit dividends no decimal. Finally 2-digit dividend with decimals. As always, though, assess your child&#039;s work and adjust as appropriate.</p>
