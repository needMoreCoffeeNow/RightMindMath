<p>OK. Addition & Subtraction & Multiplication = <b><u>DONE.</u></b></p>

<p>On to Long Division.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Get Ready for the FINAL AHA!! Moment.</span> Long division is a <u>complex process made easy by instant recall.</u></p>

<p>The videos below are both excellent. They also present the solution in a format nearly identical to how RMM presents the long division process.</p>

<p>The first video shows problems without decimal place answers. The second provides a really good explanation of decimal places &amp; long division.</p>

<hr>

<p>You should progress thru long-division by steadily increasing the complexity of the problems. The options are:
<ol>
<li>1 or 2 digit dividend (372/3=93 vs. 372/93=4)</li>
<li>Whole answers vs. answers with a decimal</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Start with 1-digit dividends. Likely next move to 1-digit dividends with decimals. Then 2-digit dividends no decimal. Finally 2-digit dividend with decimals. As always, though, assess your child&#039;s work and adjust as appropriate.</p>

<p>Chunking is always available when doing long division. Its presentation is a little different compared to m2 problems because there can be remainders. As with m2, you should encourage using chunkit because it provides even more right-left mind dance practice.</p>
