<p>RMM uses the database built into your browser for everything. No other browser storage devices like cookies are used.</p>

<p>When you first start RMM it needs to setup its database. Since RMM&#039;s database can be sync&#039;ed across multiple devices, each device&#039;s records need to be unique. The device name you enter is used for this. <span style="font-size:90%;">(Your device name is combined with a 3-digit value to ensure uniqueness.)</span></p>

<p>The <u>Guest</u> user is a default user that already exists when you start RMM. What is special about the Guest user is that no usage data is stored for it.</p>

<p>When you setup your child as a user, everything related to the problems they solve is stored in the database. <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">So if someone wants to play around with RMM on your child&#039;s device, be sure to switch to the Guest user. This keeps your child&#039;s data pristine.</span></p>
