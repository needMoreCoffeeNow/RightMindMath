<p>As noted on the main page <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">your engagement with &amp interest in your child&#039;s learning process</span> is the most important factor that will help them learn. Engagement &amp; interst are far more important than the app you use.</p>

<p>Fortunately <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">with RMM this natural &amp; easy for you.</span> It also only takes minutes of your time. Here is how to make this so:</p>

<p><b>Have your child use RMM regularly (hopefully daily):</b> As explained in a previous Topic right-mind learning requires doing a lot of single-digit arithmetic. As also noted, this is not so burdensome for your child because RMM is relaxing &amp; fun. So please try to set up a time for 10 to 20 minutes of RMM each day. Yep, that&#039;s all it takes.</p>

<p><b>Regularly review the performance charts:</b> (Once every few days or weekly.) RMM&#039;s easy-to-use charts are important because they show your child&#039;s progress. Your review of the charts also tells your child you care &#151; that is very important also.</p>

<p><b>Manage the &amp; pop-ups:</b> RMM uses popups to pause the process to give a moment for you child to consider what has happened (the problem just solved), or what is about to happen (e.g. borrowing). At some point, though, it will be more important for your child to <i>get into the flow</i>. Ask your child every once in a while if they want the popups off.<p>

<p><b>Help with &amp; manage the notes:</b> RMM presents text notes to explain things like carries &amp; borrows. For example when doing single-digit addition you will very quickly get a note explaining the carry for an equation like 8+3=11. You should be sure your child understands these notes. As with popups, the notes are less necessary as your child advances &amp; they may start to interrupt the flow. Ask your child every once in a while if they want the notes for the equation they are using to be shut off.<p>

<p><b>Watch the recommended videos with your child:</b> In both the Topics, and in some RMM dialogs there are links to great &amp; important math concept videos. Be sure to watch these with your child &amp; talk about them enough for you to be confident your child understands them.<p>
