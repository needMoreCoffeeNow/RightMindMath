<p><span style="background-color:#ffffcc"><b>Chunking:</b> The mental process of using grouping to simplify multi-digit multiplications.</span></p>

<p><u>ChunkIt</u> is introduced with M2 (two-digit multiplication) problems. Please consider using it. Learning to chunk is very useful &#151; it really is a good life skill.</p>

<p>When selecting M2 problems you have the option of using the basic or the chunkit approach. Basic walks through each step. So if problem is 84x15, RMM will walk thru step one of the process:
<ol>
<li>4x5=20</li>
<li>Record 0 (4x5) in the ones column</li>
<li>Carry the 2 to the tens column</li>
<li>Record 420 ((8*5)+2) in the hundreds
</ol>
</p>

<p>Stick with this basic process until you are confident your child has mastered it. Then show them <b>The Power of Chunking.</b></p>

<p>Suddenly the basic steps disappear and <b>420</b> is one of the four answers. Plus there is the <u>big blue ChunkIt button</u>. When they click <u>ChunkIt</u> they will see 84x5 chunked:
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;20 = 4 x 5</li>
<li>400 = 80 x 5</li>
<li>420 = Total</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Initially they will likely rely on the <u>ChunkIt</u> button to find the right answer. Yeah it is cheating, but not really.

<p><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Chunking is a joint right+left mind dance.</span> Just like any dance pair, when right+left start out they are a bit slow &amp; awkward. However by both practicing a lot &amp; watching others (the ChunkIt button) they get better.</p>

<p>Given time &amp; the opportunity to Chunkit your child will leave the <u>Chunkit</u> button behind. <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Their right+left pair will be dancing so quickly &amp; surely that selecting the right answer will be nearly instantaneous.</span></p>
