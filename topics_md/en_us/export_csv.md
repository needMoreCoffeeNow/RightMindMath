<p>RMM&#039;s chart function provides a good analysis of your child&#039;s performance. More detail, though, can be wrung from the data. RMM provides a usage data export to support this.</p>

<p>You can export your child&#039;s usage data in the Stats menu. The format used for this is a "Comma Separated Value" file (CSV).</p>

<p>CSV is one of the most common formats for data exports. For example Excel can open a CSV file &amp; automatically format data into columns and rows as an Excel Spreadsheet.</p>


<p>The download will include all levels of use in one file. RMM also provides a Python script that will allow you to pretty easily use the CSV even if you are not technically inclined.</p>
