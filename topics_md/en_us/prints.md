<p>RMM has a very nice Print function in the Settings [gear] menu. When you click <u>Print</u> a sheet of problems will be rendered. Send this to your printer &amp; you have a pencil+paper worksheet. The type of problem in the worksheet will be the same as what is currently being done on the screen.</p>

<p>The worksheet with answers is saved in RMM&#039;s database. So when you need to grade a page open the sheet with the <u>show answers</u> option clicked. Typically you will delete the sheet once grading is done.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">For single-digit problems you should consider worksheets only after you child has mastered the problem set.</span> Using pencil+paper will benefit your child by familiarizing them with the format. With instant recall filling out the sheet will be trivial for them &#151; so also a good confidence builder.</>

<p><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Unlike single-digit, printed worksheets are an important part of the multi-digit learning process.</span> Multi-digit problem solutions always involve the process of solving a series of single-digit problems. (Remember: processes are a left-mind activity.)</p>

<p>RMM is exceptional at presenting an walking your child thruough theses processes. Seeing the process automatically appear on a screen, however, is not a good substitute for the mechanics of putting pencil to paper. It has been consistently shown that the mechanics of writing helps the left-mind focus &amp; learn.</p>

<p>So remember: <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Use worksheets liberally during the time your child is how to solve multi-digit problems. They will learn faster &amp; better.</span> And should they ever face putting pencil to paper for something like an exam, they will be full of confidence.</p>
