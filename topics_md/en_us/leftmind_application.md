<p>If your child is better served with the calculating (left-mind) approach to learnng, you may still want to consider RMM.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">If you focus your child&#039;s effort on answering correctly first time, you can effectively use RMM the same as all other left-minded math apps.</span></p>

<p>The only real difference when using RMM in this mode versus other apps is that there is a much smaller penalty for being wrong for single-digit equations.</p>

<p>Most other apps reviewed by <i>The Software Author</i> (TSA) of RMM only allow one answer before marking your child wrong, and moving on. RMM, of course, will allow additional clicks until the right answer is found.</p>

<p>RMM&#039;s softer approach might assist, or might detract from left-mind learning. Since it is free &amp; easy to install, <b>Please evaluate it yourself</b></p>

<p><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">One point in RMM&#039;s favor, though, is how effectively helps your child learn the processes by which multi-digit problems &amp; long division are solved.</span> These processes are always left-minded. Despite its name RMM is a fantastic tool for learning them.</p>

<p>Before you make your decision please walk-thru all the different multi-digit solution processes. Trying to be objective, TSA feels that RMM is better than in this area than any other apps reviewed by TSA. <span style="font-size:90%;">(A large but not exhaustive list.)</span></p>

<p>Making your own determination &#151; again &#151; is free &amp; easy. TSA has nothing to gain if you chose to use RMM. <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">TSA only hopes you will evaluate RMM carefully because there are a lot of mediocre math apps that are marketed skillfully as being worth your while.</span></p>
