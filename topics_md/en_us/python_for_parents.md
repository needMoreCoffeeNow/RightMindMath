<p>Nothing says <b>I care about you learning math</b> more than becoming a Data Scientist (DS) whose focus is analyzing your child&#039;s progress in RMM.</p>

<p>OK the statement above is hyperbole (exaggerated). But there is an element of truth to it. Also, if you are new to data analysis with Python, running the data science analysis process should be fun, enlightening, and engaging for both you &amp; your child.</p>

<p>If you are thinking "No Way!" you will be surprised. Thanks to some nice developers it is pretty easy to use Python for DS activities. RMM&#039;s simple analysis script is pretty powerful, and pretty (maybe even very) easy to run.</p>

<p>It sounds impossible, but it is not. Becoming a <i>RMM Data Scientist</i> only requires following some simple instructions.</p>

<p>There are two relatively easy steps to accomplish this:</p>

<p><b>First:</b> Install the Anaconda distribution of Python using the following link. Note: You only need the main Python app. You can ignore the other optional components.

<p><b>Second:</b> Click the link that follows which is a zip file from the RMM Github project. The page will provide a "download" button for the file. Download the file and unzip it in the folder where you want to store the Python script, and input/output files. This likely should be in your Documents folder not in your Applications folder. (You will be running what is called a "script" in the unzipped folder which is not the same as the apps in your Application folder.)

<p>There will be a "documentation" folder in the unzipped directory. It has text files you can open &amp; review which explain everything you need to know.</p>

<p>If you want to preview these text files at the Github site, use the links below (all open in a new window)</p>
