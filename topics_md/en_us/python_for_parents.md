<p>Nothing says <b>I care about you learning math</b> more than becoming a Data Scientist (DS) whose focus is analyzing your child&#039;s progress in RMM.

<p>Do not despair. RMM can make you a DS.</p>

<p>A Real Data Scientist.</p>

<p>You will be running a Python script (Python is a top-3 tool for DS&#039;s) to provide easily-understandable, fantastic insights about your child&#039;s RMM learning.</p>

<p>It sounds impossible, but it is not. Becoming a <i>RMM Data Scientist</i> only requires following some simple instructions.</p>
