<p>This Topic references the Common Core (CC) learning method for early elementary school. It is valuable to review the CC objectives using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22common+core+state+standards%22&ei=kP_eY7mtFc-90PEPxr-I0Ak&ved=0ahUKEwi5teH4lv38AhXPHjQIHcYfApoQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=%22common+core+state+standards%22&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQ6CggAEEcQ1gQQsANKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQvwlYvwlgpwtoAXABeACAAXKIAXKSAQMwLjGYAQCgAQHIAQjAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp">This Search Link (changes year-to-year)</a> <span style="font-size:75%;">(opens a new window)</span></p>

<p>Very generally speaking the CC starts arithmetic off with addition in Second grade, moving on to subtraction, then multiplication. The time span to complete this is roughly two years. Note: this is the <b>basic arithmetic</b> part of the CC &#151; many more key concepts are also taught over this period.</p>

<p>Within a subject like addtion there are multiple learning steps such as:
<ol>
<li>Single-digit positive integers [4 + 3 = 7],</li>
<li>Single-digit with +/- integers [4 + -3 = 1], then</li>
<li>Multi-digit addition.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The topics that follow provide suggested approaches to: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. Links to helpful videos are provided when a new concept gets applied such as <b>Borrowing for Subtraction.</b></p>

<p><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">Remember, though, that each child is unique. You may want to use a different approach because of this.</span> If you stay engaged &amp; interested you will undoubtedly get feedback from your child to guide your decisions.</p>

<p>Finally a quick note about <span style="background-color:#ffffcc">using charts to measure single-digit learning.</span> When starting out an average of more than 10-15 seconds &amp; more than one try is expected. Remember at this point the right-mind has not learned the pattern. Once your child responds instantaneously you will see an average of a few seconds &amp; one try to find the correct answer. At this point move on to the next step.</p>
