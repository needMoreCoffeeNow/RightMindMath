<p>Our brains are made up of two parts: <i>Right</i> &amp; <i>Left</i>. The right is very good at instantaneous response. The left is good at things like logic, calculations, and procedural stuff.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:#ffffcc">The right mind learns through a process of association. It learns by recognizing patterns that it sees repeatedly.</span></p>

<p>For example: If you are introduced to someone once or twice you will probably need to "remember the introduction" to recall their name.</p>

<p>However, if you meet them enough your right mind associates the name with the face. Now anytime you meet them again, even years later, you instantly know their name. It just "happens".</p>

<p>RMM&#039;s design enables a child to learn the patterns of simple arithmetic. Imagining <span style="font-size:80%;">(not calculating)</span> the right answer "quiets" the left mind allowing the right focus &amp; learn.</p>

<ul>
<li>No Calculating</li>
<li>No Pressure</li>
<li>No Strenuous Effort</li>
</ul>

<p>Seems strange, but this is how the right mind learns. As Daniel Kahneman** describes it: <em>"...you experience greater cognitive ease in perceiving a word [or an equation] you have seen earlier, and it is this sense of ease that gives you the impression of familiarity."</em></p>
